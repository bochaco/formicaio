## Introduction

### Simplify your decentralized experience with Formicaio

Formicaio is an intuitive application designed to help you run and manage nodes on the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) network. This P2P network allows users to share storage and bandwidth in exchange for ANT tokens, an ERC-20 token on the Arbitrum One network.

The name "Formicaio" is derived from the Italian word for "anthill", symbolizing the collaborative and structured nature of both ants and the decentralized network it supports. Just as ants work together to build and maintain their colonies, Formicaio empowers users to collaborate and contribute to the Autonomi network.

### What is Autonomi?

Autonomi is a decentralized storage and bandwidth sharing network where users can earn ANT tokens by contributing their resources. The network operates on Arbitrum One, providing fast and cost-effective transactions. (https://forum.autonomi.community/t/formicaio)

## Features

### üöÄ Node Management Made Easy

With Formicaio, you can easily run and manage nodes using either a graphical user interface (GUI) or a terminal. This flexibility allows you to perform various actions on individual nodes or groups of selected nodes:

- **Create new nodes** with customizable settings
- **Start or stop nodes** individually or in batches
- **Recycle nodes** to generate new peer IDs
- **Remove nodes** when no longer needed
- **Upgrade nodes** when new binary versions are available
- **View individual node logs** in real-time
- **Monitor memory and CPU usage** with detailed charts
- **Sort nodes** by different criteria (creation date, status, connected peers, etc.)

<img src="img/screenshot_06.png" width="400" height="212" />

### üìä Real-time Monitoring & Statistics

The Formicaio backend actively monitors your nodes, providing real-time status updates and comprehensive statistics:

- **Rewards balance** for each node
- **Memory and CPU usage** tracking
- **Number of records** stored locally
- **Current peer connections** count
- **Peers in routing table** (k-buckets)
- **Shunned peers** tracking
- **Estimated total nodes** in the network

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Settings

A comprehensive settings panel allows you to customize monitoring tasks and node management:

- **Auto-upgrade nodes** when new binary versions are available
- **Configurable delays** for node upgrades
- **Version check frequency** for the node binary
- **Token balance query frequency**
- **Metrics retrieval frequency**
- **ERC20 token contract configuration** (address and RPC URL)
- **LCD display configuration** for external monitoring

### üåê Network Connectivity Options

When setting up nodes, you can define their connection type and custom data directory:

- **UPnP support**: Attempts to use UPnP to open a port on your home router for incoming connections. If your router doesn't support UPnP, create nodes with UPnP disabled to ensure connectivity.
- **Listening IP address**: This address determines which network interface the node will bind to for incoming connections. The application supports both IPv4 (e.g., `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`) and IPv6 (e.g., `::`, `fe80::1`) addresses, allowing users to control whether the node is accessible on all interfaces, only locally, or on a specific network. This flexibility is useful for running nodes in different environments, such as local development, private networks, or public-facing deployments.
- **Custom data directory**: This directory is where the node will store its persistent data, such as chunks, logs, and configuration files. By assigning a unique data directory to each node, or batch of nodes, users can run multiple nodes on the same machine without data conflicts. This option is especially valuable for advanced setups or when running nodes with different hard disks or mounting points.

### MCP Server for Integration with AI Agents

The MCP server of Formicaio is designed to seamlessly integrate with any AI agent. This flexibility allows users to leverage the capabilities of various AI models with Formicaio. To illustrate this integration, check out the video demonstration below that showcases how the MCP server can be effectively combined with [n8n](https://n8n.io), an open-source workflow automation tool. 

The video highlights the simplicity of connecting Formicaio with AI agents to automate tasks and streamline processes. You can see the integration in action using [n8n](https://n8n.io). We interact with Formicaio through an AI agent via chat, as well as demonstrate how to schedule a task that monitors CPU usage. Based on the detected CPU capacity on the host, the system can automatically request Formicaio to add or remove nodes, ensuring optimal performance. This is the AI prompt used in this showcase:
```text
Make sure the CPU usage on the host is below 50%. If it is, add a new node instance on Formicaio with the same properties as the existing nodes, using a port number that is one higher than the highest current port. Also, keep the total number of nodes to 3; if there are more than 3, remove the extra ones.
```
